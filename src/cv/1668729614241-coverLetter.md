## Re: Application for the position of Jedi Master

&NewLine;

Dear Grand Master Yoda,  
&NewLine;

I am writing to apply for the Jedi Master position at the Jedi High Council as advertised in Star Wars Job Bulletin. My training and experience in the Force, along with my ability to construct a lightsaber through self-learning, make me the perfect candidate for the job. I know that I would be a valuable addition to the Jedi High Council.  
&NewLine;

I have been trained under powerful Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi for a considerable time. I was bestowed with the title of Jedi Knight.
&NewLine;

In my most recent role with the title of Jedi Knight, I fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire and have traveled across the galaxy to search for knowledge to rebuild the Jedi Order. Before that, I have self-taught to fly an X-wing and destroyed the Empire's deadly weapon - the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin.
&NewLine;

I am excited to apply to the Jedi High Council and believe that I am the perfect candidate for the post.  
&NewLine;

Please find attached my CV. Feel free to contact me directly should you require anything further.  
&NewLine;

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.  
&NewLine;

Yours sincerely,  
&NewLine;

Luke Skywalker
